# Gomon
 CLI tool to run your go code changes automatically and restarts your application.

## Requirements
 * Go >= 1.24.
 * mac or linux. (sorry windows, you don't deserve to have my tool)
    
## How to use?
 Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/mani-arjunan/gomon.git` and run `./init.sh`,
now go to any of your golang repo and run `gomon`.

> **NOTE:** For now, this tool only works for a single file `main.go`, it doesn't track any other
deps across your repos.
